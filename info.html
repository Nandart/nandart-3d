  <h1>About NANdART</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      NANdART is not just a gallery — it is a sanctuary. A place where art transcends format, where memory becomes brushstroke, and identity finds shape in texture and light.
      Our mission is to elevate the presence of digital and physical artworks into timeless reflections, curated with care and hosted with integrity.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Technology with Soul</h2>
    <p>
      Powered by Web3, built with Three.js, and anchored on the Polygon blockchain, NANdART ensures each artwork remains secure, verifiable and eternally accessible.
      Our approach blends high-performance rendering with decentralised permanence — because we believe that beauty deserves endurance.
    </p>

    <h2>A Vision for the Future</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a world where galleries live in the cloud and souls leave their trace in pixels and code. 
      NANdART is a bridge between past and future, analogue and digital, the intimate and the universal.
      In every cube, a world. In every crystal, a voice. In every artist, a story that deserves to be remembered.
